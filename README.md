This repository had some early code for letting a Drupal site push the
update status to Jira as issues.

The code was never a working solution.

If you want something similar today combine the
[Update Rules](https://www.drupal.org/project/update_rules) and
[Jira REST Rules](https://www.drupal.org/project/jira_rest_rules)
modules (I actually created the `jira_rest_rules` module for exactly
that purpose).
